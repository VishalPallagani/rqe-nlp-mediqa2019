(This library contains interfaces for other pretrained language models like OpenAI's GPT and GPT-2.) We've selected the pytorch interface because it strikes a nice balance between the high-level APIs (which are easy to use but don't provide insight into how things work) and tensorflow code (which contains lots of details but often sidetracks us into lessons about tensorflow, when the purpose here is BERT!).\n","\n","At the moment, the Hugging Face library seems to be the most widely accepted and powerful pytorch interface for working with BERT. In addition to supporting a variety of different pre-trained language models (and future models to come - BERT will not be state of the art forever), the library also includes pre-built modifications of BERT suited to your specific task. For example, in this tutorial we will use BertForSequenceClassification, but the library also includes BERT modifications designed for token classification, question answering, next sentence prediciton, etc. Using these pre-built classes simplifies the process of modifying BERT for your purposes.\n","\n","**Note**: as of July 2019, the pytorch library called \"pytorch-pretrained-bert pytorch-nlp\" has been updated and renamed as \"pytorch-transformers.\" Though the old name still works, there is a short summary [here](https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-transformers#Migrating-from-pytorch-pretrained-bert-to-pytorch-transformers) about migrating to the new library.

There's a lot going on, but fundamentally for each pass in our loop we have a trianing phase and a validation phase. At each pass we need to:\n","\n","Training loop:\n","- Tell the model to compute gradients by setting the model in train mode\n","- Unpack our data inputs and labels\n","- Load data onto the GPU for acceleration\n","- Clear out the gradients calculated in the previous pass. In pytorch the gradients accumulate by default (useful for things like RNNs) unless you explicitly clear them out\n","- Forward pass (feed input data through the network)\n","- Backward pass (backpropagation)\n","- Tell the network to update parameters with optimizer.step()\n","- Track variables for monitoring progress\n","\n","Evalution loop:\n","- Tell the model not to compute gradients by setting th emodel in evaluation mode\n","- Unpack our data inputs and labels\n","- Load data onto the GPU for acceleration\n","- Forward pass (feed input data through the network)\n","- Compute loss on our validation data and track variables for monitoring progress\n","\n","So please read carefully through the comments to get an understanding of what's happening. If you're unfamiliar with pytorch a quick look at some of their [beginner tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html#sphx-glr-beginner-blitz-cifar10-tutorial-py) will help show you that training loops really involve only a few simple steps; the rest is usually just decoration and logging.

Dear MedlinePus  I started to fly at the age of 15 and have been flying for over 3,5 years and has logged over 120 hours in my time as pilot. My dream is to become a Comerical Pilot and recently I undertook a medical class 1 which I failed in Norway because of my Eye position and Eye movment, hence I have not experienced any problem with my vision in daily life nor when I have been flying..  The problem is that my binocular vision is not good enough and the eye-doctor meant it could be a problem if I sudden developed double vision.  Is there any operation that can fix this? The Orthoptics I went to meant there was a problem with one of the eye muscles which where to tight and the other too weak. She said it can be fixed, but this is not \"normal\"; in Norway because it is not big enough error she meant.  Is there anyway to fix this? I appreciate all information!
